
1.
Some of the projects are using hardcoded paths for now.
Copy the files to "C:/OpenCV.3.1":
- C:/OpenCV.3.1/build <- unzip the 7z files here
- C:/OpenCV.3.1/Solution

For convenience I uploaded the prebuilt binary for the final project:
- C:/OpenCV.3.1/Solution/_outdir/Release_x86/Release_x86.7z <- unzip

2.
Originally the projects where created for OpenCV 2.4. 
Project lab04 does not build as it it was not converted yet to OpenCV 3.1.
Syntax error: unknown identifiers:
- 'OrbFeatureDetector'
- 'OrbDescriptorExtractor'
- 'SurfFeatureDetector'
- 'SurfDescriptorExtractor'
